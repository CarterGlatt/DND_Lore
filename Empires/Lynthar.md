Lynthar are mythical winged beasts, which were the primary threat at the end of the [[Aetherial Conflict]].  Not much is known about these creatures, as they only emerged at the very end of the conflict to completely devastate mankind.  What little is known about Lynthar that has been passed down is that they seem to be capable of innately controlling raw aether energy, which can then be used by the Lynthar to create large energy blasts which most mortals cannot withstand.
