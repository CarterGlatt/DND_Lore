The Vilcolla Vale is the name of the valley that the [[The Dominion of Vallonde||Dominion]] is located within.  Surrounded by mountains on all sides, the only entrance to the valley was the [[Zanula Caves]], but this entrance was sealed by the founders of the Dominion.   Due to this, the vale is effectively isolated from what remains of the outside world.

### Geography
The valley itself is relatively flat, with the primary landmark being [[Cymeia Lake]] at the center of the valley.  The terrain is somewhat mixed between plains and forest, before turning into more barren, rocky desert at the bottom of the mountains that surround the valley.  There are also two large waterfalls. one near the military fortress of [[Seford]], and the other just outside the perimeter walls of [[Elhyrst Academy]]. 

### Wildlife
While not a complete wilderness, the terrain surrounding the various settlements and towns are still home to some undomesticated animals.  Most of the animals remaining in the wild are relatively harmless to citizens within the valley, and won't attack unless provoked by a passing party.  Some domesticated animals, such as livestock or horses, are occasionally allowed to graze in the immediate area outside village walls.
