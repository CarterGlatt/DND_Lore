#### General Information
The original purpose of Burga Keep was to create a fortification to protect the [[Sapphire Sanctum]], a major library complex storing important knowledge that pre-dates the end of the [[Aetherial Conflict]].  Access to the Sanctum is rather limited, with even basic access being restricted to those approved by the [[The Seekers of the Broken Circle ||Seekers]].  The Seeker's monastery is also located within the walls of the keep, which serves as the primary training ground for various monks.
#### Important Locations
- **The Monastery of the First Word** — home to the [[The Seekers of the Broken Circle|Seekers]], monks of this monastery focus on the preservation of existing knowledge, especially knowledge that existed prior to the end of the [[Aetherial Conflict|Conflict]].  While most monks train here to help run the Sanctum and protect its knowledge, some monks here focus on attempting to determine if other influential groups are attempting to hide important knowledge from the rest of humanity.
- **The Celestial Observatory** — located outside the Sanctum, the observatory is open to anyone, and is often used as a place of study/research for those trying to figure out the mysteries of the stars and sky.
- **The Arcane Vaults** — Working in conjunction with [[Elhyrst Academy]], the Arcane Vaults are a collection of arcane scrolls, magical items, and other constructs/materials imbued with arcane energy.  The items stored in the vaults are often considered extremely dangerous, and despite being protected by the Seekers, are typically only accessible by high ranking members of the Academy.
#### Political Affiliation/Status
Royal rule is often questioned by the monks at Burga Keep.  Due to the quest to both obtain new, secretive knowledge, as well as protect what little knowledge exists of the old world, there is often confusion as to why the royal family has made such little effort to explain how the world used to be, and why humanity has been left with so little compared to what they theoretically had access to.  Due to this, the monks at the Keep are extremely supportive of efforts to excavate a path through the Zanula Caves to reconnect with the remnants of the outside world, as there is more untapped knowledge to be had outside the [[Vilcolla Vale]].
