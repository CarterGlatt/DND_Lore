Cymeia Lake is the primary body of water located within the [[Vilcolla Vale]].   Formed by the connection of the two waterfalls located within the vale, the lake itself serves as an important method of transporting goods to various towns and villages throughout the [[The Dominion of Vallonde]].  Many small villages, like those of Menione and Elloriad, act as fishing villages, with Cymeia Lake serving as the primary location for catching fish.

While passage across the lake is generally unrestricted, vessels approaching the various islands that comprise Crawic often deal with more imposed rules; various shipping and transport lanes into and out of the various ports have made navigating the Crawic waters very taxing, albeit efficient in terms of speed.  For this reason, many smaller groups choose to deliver product to towns such as Hayminster, as the time delay in arriving to Crawic provides less of a penalty to profits than potentially breaking rules regarding Crawic shipping.
