The capital and primary city within [[The Dominion of Vallonde ||Vallonde]], Crawic consists of three main sections:
- **Crawic Proper** — the primary urban center of the city, this is located on the large island of Crawic at the center of [[Cymeia Lake]].  This is the only portion of the city that is encompassed within a layer of walls, and is home to the upper class and elite nobility of the Dominion.
- **Upper Crawic** — the small outlying districts located north of Crawic; these districts are connected via bridges to the main island, as well as by a bridge that connects to the path to Beywick.
- **Lower Crawic** — the outlying districts south of Crawic; the districts in this area have many smithies and other labor intensive professions, as this is the sector that processes the materials brought in from Wyemoor and Hayminster.

#### General Information
Crawic is the primary hub of the Dominion — all governance comes from within the inner city, and anyone who seeks to gain political power finds their way to the city in one way or another.  In terms of demographic makeup, Crawic is the most diverse of all locations found within the Dominion, as the city was developed from the remnants of the recovering troop population after the [[Aetherial Conflict]].  Being the heart of the Dominion, it is no surprise that the population (especially within the inner city) are extremely patriotic and loyal to the crown, and any discussion of dissidence within city boundaries carries severe punishment.

#### Important Places
- **The Imperial Castle** — home to [[Averia Adhon-Sturmgeis]] and her husband, the royal family lives and rules over the Vallonde from this castle.  It is extremely noticeable, even from a distance, due to the 7 large towers that comprise the various corners of their estate.  The increased military and police presence outside the home is a separate indicator of the status of the structure.
- **The Tribunal** — the primary location of imperial law preceding's, the Tribunal is where the Grand Magistrate of the Dominion issues verdicts on various cases. 
- **Stoneclad Hold** — the imperial prison, located adjacent to the Tribunal.  The worst of the worst of the Dominion citizenry call this place home.
- **The Bloodstone Coliseum** — a large, elliptical arena; this is where many important large gatherings occur, including the yearly [[Crucible of Glory]].
- **Korrivik Theatre** — a amphitheater structure located on the outskirts of Crawic Proper, many public shows are put on to entertain the local population.  In addition, many important announcements by political or business leaders are completed here, due to the large attendance space, and good acoustics for such an event/proclamation.

#### Political Affiliation/Standing
Due to being the seat of the Dominion, and being directly ruled by a member of the Royal Family, Crawic is extremely loyal to the crown.  Any acts that sow dissent (intentional or accidental) are treated swiftly, and severely.  While there may be murmurings of dissent amongst portions of the population, any official groups or discussion are kept underground, and attempts to join said groups are rather difficult.
