## Background
The Dominion of Vallonde is a formidable empire existing within the [[Vilcolla Vale]].  Created in the waning days of the [[Aetherial Conflict]], the initial settlements that would later become Vallonde were created as military installations.  The future imperial capital, [[Crawic]], was initially founded as a large scale infirmary for injured troops, while the fortress town of [[Wyemoor]] served as a general protective wall for the vale, as well as the primary base for military leadership away from the frontlines.

The [[Aetherial Conflict |Conflict]] continued on, and slowly, became a losing fight for the unified forces.  Unwilling to sacrifice more lives for a cause that seemed lost, the general of the forces, [[Oswyn Adhon]], pulled all remaining troops into the valley through the [[Zanula Caves]] and into the vale, before collapsing the caves behind them.  From then on, society would live within this valley, healing and growing back in strength, while still being vigilant for any future attacks from the enemy--attacks which never came.

Oswyn Adhon became the first leader of the valley, initially ruling from the fortress of Wyemoor.  However, through cooperation and continual development, Oswyn saw the establishment of Crawic into a proper capital city, and moved the governance of the dominion to the city, where it remains to this day.

## Other Locations

#### Galone
A small, remote village in the Narford forest; traditionally stays out of imperial affairs, and is often forgotten about by citizens in other regions of the vale.  Self-sufficient, the villagers live a more rustic, hunting/fishing based lifestyle, and trade with the villagers of Menione for various goods/services.

##### Menione
The other remote village in the Narford forest; despite being further away from most imperial influence, Menione is more involved with the government than the village of Galone; Menione is known for their large involvement in fishing within the Barione River, with fish being a primary export.

##### Llynno
A remote town technically located outside imperial jurisdiction, Llynno currently serves as a town to process the various excavated material from the Zanula Mines.   Seemingly a dwarven town, much of the population lives here in cyclical patterns, being stationed onsite for upwards of six months at a time, before being sent home to recuperate for a three month period.  This has led to the village being relatively basic, with no real amenities outside those needed for the working population.

##### Cheawood
A relatively new town, Cheawood was initially used as a staging area that was used during the construction of Seford Stronghold, but has since become a residence for immediate family and/or loved ones of those serving in the [[Cinderwatch]].  Cheawood is relatively basic, but has all of the basic amenities of a typical medieval town.  Due to the towns involvement with the [[Cinderwatch]], the citizens of Cheawood are extremely patriotic, and will not support anyone who speaks against the will of the Crown.

##### Nala
A small, coastal village situated on [[Cymeia Lake]].  Seen as a sort of retirement village, Nala is home to several wealthy elite members of society, which has led to Nala being extremely opulent despite its size.

##### Beywick
A former farming village, Beywick now serves as the primary town outside of Burga Keep, home to the [[Sapphire Sanctum]] library complex, and the home of the [[The Seekers of the Broken Circle]], which is a monastery of monks who help run the Sanctum.   Due to the affiliation with [[Burga Keep]], many citizens of Beywick are against the isolationist view of the current Queen, [[Averia Adhon-Sturmgeis]], and wish to reopen a passage to the outside world—a view which they will not openly express out of fear of imprisonment.

##### Orleim
An average sized town, typically seen as a stopping point when travelling between Beywick and [[Elhyrst Academy]] on this side of [[Cymeia Lake]].  Relatively loyal to the empire, but has similar underground tendencies to oppose the crown.

##### Elliorad
A small fishing village on [[Cymeia Lake]].  In exchange for various crafted supplies, Elliorad often supplies various fish and other aquatic foods as part of trade with Neu Vallo and Badoro.  

##### Neu Vallo
A small village that specializes in making equipment for arcana-based individuals.  Typical supplies, such as magical ink, arcana-infused paper, and spellbooks are crafted and sold here, along with other traditional supplies, such as paper, ink, and other traditional book-based materials.  Extremely popular amongst wizards at the academy due to the accessibility of important materials, Neu Vallo has a very negative impression amongst sorcerers, as they feel that the citizens of Neu Vallo take too much pity on the weak, worthless wizards that try to learn at the academy.

##### Badoro
A small village just outside of [[Elhyrst Academy |Academy]] grounds, Badoro in recent years has become a arcana-based society.  Many of the important mages and sorcerers that help run the academy, as well as serve important places within the central government, were born in Badoro within the past 75 years, solidifying Badoro's place as the prime place to come from if one wishes to master the arcane.
