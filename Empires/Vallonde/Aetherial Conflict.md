The Aetherial Conflict is the name for a series of ongoing wars and conflicts that culminated into the retreat of what remained of civilization into the [[Vilcolla Vale]] before the valley was sealed behind.  While thorough documentation of the events of the Conflict are rather difficult to find, there is a general understanding of the conflict that has been passed down by the elders, and is now taught as the origin story for how civilization came to survive and thrive as the [[The Dominion of Vallonde||Dominion]].  

### *First Aetherial Conflict*
According to legend, the Aetherial Conflict initially started as a set of armed conflicts between various nations fighting for control over various territories and the resources held within (namely, [[Aether Crystals]]).  This scramble for resources essentially dissolved the established geopolitical norm, as countries would make deals with whatever other forces would put them in the best position to benefit from the war.  As the war continued, countries began betraying each other to establish as stronger position, eventually culminating in a world-wide free-for-all war.

The initial set of wars would continue waging for approximately 80 years, before most resources needed for war and general survival became scarce.  During this time, the armed forces led by [[Oswyn Adhon]] attempted to utilize the area within the [[Vilcolla Vale]] as a prime location to protect innocent civilians that were located in the general area around his front.  After establishing the initial medical camp at [[Crawic]], Adhon would return outside the vale to continue to improve the defensive position outside the valley.  Over time, the medical camp at Crawic became fully established as a village, and refugees from around the area would flock to the valley to attempt to rebuild their life.

With the temporary truce in place for about 6 years, some members from within the valley began seeking to establish new settlements outside the valley for the first time.  To many, this seemed to be the end of the conflict, as individuals were seeking to finally end the war that had killed between 35% and 55% of the known population of the world.  Many settlements were established across the various regions involved in the war, and to the best of the ability of the war survivors, civilization appeared to reemerge from the ashes of the war.  

One of the settlements located just outside of the defensive position Adhon established was the town of [[Amberford]].  Originally established as a mining outpost, the town grew into a small trade hub, and was used to connect several new communities.  Unfortunately, during the mining operations conducted within the town, a new, massive vein of Aether Crystals was discovered, and the various armed forces that still remained from the end of the war emerged to attempt to take control over the valuable resource.

### *Second Aetherial Conflict*
Oswyn Adhon saw the various groups coming to take control of the crystal mines at Amberford as a large threat towards the peaceful lives that village settlers had managed to establish--settlers who, in the not so distant past, used to be under Adhon's protection.  In an attempt to make peace in the region, Adhon sent a peacekeeping military force to guard the mines and provide access to all.  The presence of the military, however, made other armed groups (as well as the villagers of Amberford) believe Adhon was attempting to take over the city by force.  The various armed groups rose up against Adhon's forces, who quickly retreated back to the primary position.  

The attack on Adhon's forces at Amberford broke the gently established peace from the previous war, sending all factions back into conflict.  This time, the main goal was control over the lucrative and vital crystal mines at Amberford, leading to most of the fighting being just outside the territory established by Adhon himself.  As his forces were continually pushed back to the last primary defensive position outside the [[Vilcolla Vale|Vale]],  Adhon made the decision to abandon this side of humanity.  The medical base he had previously established, [[Crawic]], had become self-reliant, and some other small villages had also been established, ensuring that at least some civilization would persist beyond the current war.  Adhon ordered his troops within the valley, and used what little explosive equipment they had remaining to detonate the tunnels behind them.   This effort to protect the innocent people within the valley cemented Adhon's position as the initial ruler of territories within the Vale.

Although the sound of large battles could be heard occasionally over the mountain ranges, these events became fewer and farther between, until one day they were heard for the last time.  It is the belief that whoever managed to survive the end of the Conflict were unable to establish a self-reliant society and simply died off, which is why there have never been any attempts from those outside the valley to establish contact with the new [[The Dominion of Vallonde]].
