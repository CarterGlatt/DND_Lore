### Background
Despite all of the chaos of the Aetherial Conflict, the citizens of the world maintained their beliefs, and worshiped the gods of the world around them in hopes that the various deities would heed their prayer, and provide them with the answers they sought after.  These deities have been passed down from the initial survivors of the camp at Crawic, and now form the primary religious deities of the [[The Dominion of Vallonde]]

- ### Tharion, God of Justice & Honor
	-  **Domain/Focus:** Law, fairness, and the enforcement of oaths.
	- **Alignment:** Lawful Good
	- **Legend:** Mortals say Tharion was born from the first oath ever sworn. They believe he walks unseen in courts and marketplaces, weighing deeds on an invisible scale. When injustice occurs, storms rise in distant lands, as if the heavens themselves demand recompense. His power is said to come from the cosmic principle that balance must always prevail.
	
- ### Sylvara, Goddess of Agriculture and Community
	- **Domain/Focus:** Growth, harvest, and communal prosperity.
	- **Alignment:** Lawful Good
	- **Legend:** Folklore tells of Sylvara planting the first seeds in a barren land, singing songs that coaxed life from the soil. Mortals believe her laughter brings rain, and her tears nurture crops. Festivals of planting and harvest are said to be her way of speaking to the people, reminding them that shared labor yields abundance.
	
- ### Kaelith, God of Adventure
	- **Domain/Focus:** Exploration, personal freedom, and risk-taking.
	- **Alignment:** Chaotic Good
	- **Legend:** Kaelith is said to ride the winds atop invisible currents, opening hidden paths and secret doors for those daring enough to follow. Mortals tell stories of travelers who find paths where none existed before, claiming it is Kaelith rewarding courage. His power is the embodiment of unpredictability and liberation, teaching mortals to embrace the unknown.
	
- ### Liora, Goddess of Art and Inspiration
	- **Domain/Focus:** Creativity, passion, and innovation.
	- **Alignment:** Chaotic Good
	- **Legend:** According to ancient myth, Liora breathed color into the world, causing sparks of creativity to ignite in minds and hands. Songs, paintings, and inventions are said to be whispers from her spirit. Her divine goal is to ensure that life remains vibrant and unrestrained, for she thrives when beauty and expression flourish.
	
- ### Morvath, God of War and Strategy
	- **Domain/Focus:** Military strategy, discipline, and conquest.    
	- **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
	- **Legend:** Worshipped heavily during the [[Aetherial Conflict]], soldiers believe that Morvath sits atop an unseen war table, moving armies like pieces on a board. Storms of conflict, sudden victories, or strategic blunders are attributed to his meticulous oversight. He is believed to value the perfection of order in battle above morality, teaching that discipline and foresight determine survival.
	
- ### Eryndis, Goddess of Knowledge and Law
	- **Domain/Focus:** Lore, law, and intellectual pursuit.
	- **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
	- **Legend**: Mortals say Eryndis collects the world’s knowledge, storing every secret and law in her invisible library. Those who stumble across new truths are thought to be guided by her subtle hand. Her influence encourages careful thought and the pursuit of wisdom, warning that knowledge without discipline leads to chaos.
	
- ### Zerath, God of Trickery and Change
	- **Domain/Focus:** Mischief, unpredictability, and upheaval.
	- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
	- **Legend:** It is believed that Zerath delights in reshaping events without warning, from sudden fortunes to shocking betrayals. Mortals tell stories of “lucky accidents” and ironic twists that cannot be explained—Zerath’s laughter is said to echo in these moments. His power embodies the impermanence of all things, reminding mortals that nothing is fixed.

- ### Nyssa, Goddess of Storms and Passion
	- **Domain/Focus:** Weather, emotion, and sudden change.
	- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
	- **Legend:** Amongst those who live in the remote villages within the vale, many believe that whenever Nyssa rages or rejoices, the skies mirror her heart. Sudden storms, unseasonal winds, and lightning strikes are all seen as her moods spilling into the world. She teaches mortals that passion is both a force of creation and destruction, and life’s intensity must be embraced.

- ### Draegor, God of Tyranny and Domination
	- **Domain/Focus:** Authority through fear, control, and conquest.
	- **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
	- **Legend:** Legends tell that Draegor’s shadow stretches across nations, bending rulers to his invisible will. Mortals believe he punishes disorder with calculated cruelty, instilling fear so that order prevails. His power represents the principle that stability comes through dominance, and weakness must be tempered with iron resolve.

- ### Vespera, Goddess of Secrets and Manipulation
	- **Domain/Focus:** Subterfuge, espionage, and control through knowledge.
	- **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
	- **Legend:** Worshipped heavily by criminals and politicans alike, those who believe in Vespera believe that Vespera knows every secret ever kept and every lie ever told. Tales speak of rulers undone by hidden truths and fortunes altered by unseen hands. Her influence shows that knowledge and subtlety can control destinies more powerfully than force, and her followers excel in subtlety and cunning.
	- 
- ### Malvok, God of Destruction and Fire
	- **Domain/Focus:** Ruin, chaos, and fiery annihilation.
	- **Alignment:** Chaotic Evil
	- **Legend:** According to legend, Malvok dances in the inferno of burning cities, laughing as flames cleanse the land. Tales tell of sudden fires and eruptions that leave devastation in their wake. Mortals believe he seeks to purge stagnation and weakness through annihilation, showing that destruction is a natural, unavoidable force.

- ### Serith, Goddess of Pestilence and Decay
	- **Domain/Focus:** Disease, rot, and inevitable decline.
	- **Alignment:** Chaotic Evil
	- **Legend:** Feared by many injured and sick soldiers in the original hospital camp at Crawic, it is believed that when Serith passes through a forest or village, she does not attack; she merely reminds life of its impermanence. Crops rot, animals grow frail, and humans fall ill—but these events are said to carry lessons of humility and respect for the fragility of life. Her power embodies the inevitability of decay and the natural cycle of existence.  For this reason, she was originally banned from being worshipped during the early years of the Dominion; whilst no longer banned, being seen worshipping Serith largely removes one from society socially.
