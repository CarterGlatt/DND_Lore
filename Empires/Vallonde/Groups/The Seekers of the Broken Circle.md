### Background
The Seekers of the Broken Circle are a mystical order that seeks to further the understanding of the outside world by taking advantage of preserved historic texts.  Headquartered within the Burga Keep, and protecting the Sapphire Sanctum, the Seekers are proficient in the use of martial arts, and are willing to accept newcomers to come and study academics and martial skills with its leaders--provided they can prove they are pure of heart.

### Founding
The Seekers of the Broken Circle were originally founded by scouts and warriors not long after [[Oswyn Adhon]] fully established [[The Dominion of Vallonde]].  Adhon's staunch isolationist approach upset these individuals, as they believed that the world was meant to be understood, not conquered, and hiding away until they were perceived as being strong enough to conquer the outside world again would only lead to the same cycle of pain occurring again.

During their exploration of the outer reaches of the [[Vilcolla Vale]],  the explorers found a large ruin, within which laid the protected structure they dubbed the [[Sapphire Sanctum]].  The Sanctum was believed to have been a library a long time ago, and held many ancient texts on the arcane, historical and technological progress, as well as general philosophical texts about how life operates. 

Fearing what the royal government would do if it found material that would potentially encourage individuals to leave the vale, the explorers established a new base at the Sanctum, rebuilding the ruins into [[Burga Keep]], and establishing the Seekers of the Broken Circle to help educate and expand ones understanding of how the world around them works, as well as how they can best be a help to society.

### Modern Day Operations
Whilst managing to keep the Sanctum completely hidden from many years, the location of the Sanctum was finally revealed and spread to major factions throughout the Vale.  However, thanks to the mystique and honor the Seekers had built up over the many years of outreach and education throughout the surrounding villages, those who opposed their work (primary the crown and their military branch, the [[Cinderwatch]], and the arcane institution of [[Elhyrst Academy]]),  the Seekers were relatively untouchable.  There have been small skirmishes on occassion between members of the various groups, but nothing that escalates into full blown faction warfare.

With their location and presence now fully known, the Seekers no longer try to hide their existence, but still protect their important knowledge reserves, which are held deep within the Sapphire Sanctum.

#### Primary Faction Goals
- Reopen the Vale to the outside world
- Train those who seek to venture outside in methods of protection/self preservation
- If possible, help reshape Elhyrst Academy into a more progressive institution, rather than one that creates weapons for the state
