The Cinderwatch serve as the armed forces for the Dominion of Vallonde.  While not used in traditional wars, due to the lack of any foreign nations to fight against, the Cinderwatch primarily serve as town guards to protect against potential local wildlife, as well as from those who seek to attack Vallonde from within.

## Structure
The Cinderwatch are broken down into three primary groups, each of which are distinguished by the unique flourish/flair on their uniforms:

#### Officer Corp
The Officer Corp consists of the elite soldiers found within the Cinderwatch ranks.  Officers start as low as rank Lieutenant, controlling around 25 soldiers, with a maximum rank of Marshall, who controls several 500 troops (split into groups of smaller rank leadership).  Officers are denoted with a red sash-like design across their otherwise pitch black uniforms.

##### Watchmen
The everyday soldiers within the Cinderwatch army.  When not in training or training new recruits, watchmen traditionally man the local village defenses, or station [[Seford Stronghold]].  While there are ranks to climb whilst enlisted as a Watchmen, the likelihood of a watchmen graduating into an officer role is extremely unlikely, as the ability to show experience in the field is extremely limited.  This has led to an unfortunate, reoccurring issue of watchmen starting disasters/issues in order to solve them themselves, providing possible watchmen promotions into the officer ranks, but these occurrences have been quashed in recent years.  Watchmen wear a traditional pitch black uniform, with small red stripes on the shoulder-blades to denote rank.

##### Recruit
Raw recruits attempting to join the watchmen.  Due to the lack of enemies/threats, membership is currently based on choice enlistment,  so the percentage of poor recruits has gone down in recent years.  However, recruits are still the most raw members the Cinderwatch has at its disposal, so recruits are almost never seen outside of [[Seford Stronghold]] until they pass their initial training process.  To denote those who are effectively unready for combat, recruits wear a bright red uniform, which is an inverse of the traditional Cinderwatch Uniform.  Once a recruit completes training, they complete the Emberwake ceremony--they remove their bright red uniform and replace it with the standard issue pitch black uniform, which symbolizes the transition from raw recruit into a refined soldier.

#### Primary Faction Goals
- Protect the crown and other forms of local governance
- Recruit new trainees
- Flesh out Officer Corp to be more than invite only; create true promotion metric to continue to have a strong officer pipeline
